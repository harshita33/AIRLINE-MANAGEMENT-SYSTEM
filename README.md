Airline Management System allows passengers to manage flight reservations for airlines. It will involve a range of features such as flight schedules, seat availability, fare management and payment processing. This system allows easy and quick ways for users to book and manage their flights. 
A new user would be required to sign up and set up their account. This account can access their current bookings, previous bookings and any upcoming travel tickets. Each user can book tickets for themselves as well as any friends/family members as each ticket will be associated with the passenger details and not the UserID.

Any valid user can login to the portal and search for the available flights using the built in search bar, filtered using the source, destination, date and timings. Further, each user can choose their desired seat subject to availability.After selecting their desired combinations, the user shall provide their details and can proceed to the payment portal and confirm their booking. A ticket will be generated for the user to authenticate their booking at the airport. It will contain all the necessary details of the user as well as their selected privileges.
